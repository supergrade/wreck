To run the test:

Go to wreck.lisp

Modify the first line to point to your base directory:
(defvar **prog-lisp-dir** "c:/prog/wreck/")

Paste the ENTIRE file into TWO command line/Win64 SBCLs

In the FIRST one - call (start-server)

In the SECOND one - call (start-stress-test)


The FIRST will now serve a web server on port 82

The SECOND one will keep connecting/disconnecting

If on the SECOND one you call (show-progress), you should see positive growing values for successes AND failures.

Within about 6-10 hours, the SERVER (FIRST) will crash to the debugger:
* fatal error encountered in SBCL pid 10604(tid 10225392):
GC invariant lost, file "gencgc.c", line 3525
